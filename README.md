# GourmetServer
Welcome to the Gourmet Java Server GitHub repo
<p>
This was developed to allow anybody to create changes to the Minecraft server without the use of remote access.
<h2>HOW TO EDIT</h2>
<p>Using <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">GitHub Desktop</a>, you can create a fork of the working directory that the server is currently using for you to edit. When finished editing, you are able to create your first<a href="https://github.com/soapstain22/GourmetServer/compare"> pull request</a> to move your changes stored in your branch into the master branch</p>
